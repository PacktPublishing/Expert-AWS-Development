# Expert AWS Development
This is the code repository for [Expert AWS Development](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/expert-aws-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788477581), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Continuous deployment and Agile methodology have enabled huge advances in modern applications. This book will enable the reader to make use of this rapidly evolving technology to build highly scalable applications within AWS using different architectures.

You will begin with installation of AWS SDK and you will get hands-on experience on creating an application using AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Next you will be integrating Applications with AWS services such as DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS and Amazon SWF


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
  <artifactId>aws-java-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>1.11.106</version>
</dependency>
```

This book assumes that readers are already familiar with the basics of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and have some development background. It explains readers about Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) and how they are achieved on AWS using Developer tools. Readers will also learn about different architectures and implement CI/CD on these architectures. Some of the troubleshooting and cost optimization tips are really helpful to the users while using different AWS services. Users can use free-tier cloud providers wherever possible; certain services might cost a small amount of money.

From a hardware point of view, you can work on any modern computer running for any operating system supported by AWS.
